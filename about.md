  <p> I'm Ed Holloway-George, a pretty bad <span class="smol">(but enthusiastic)</span> PTCG player and professor from Nottingham, UK.</p>
  
  <p> I have played the Pokemon TCG online since 2012, played semi-regularly IRL since 2016 and I started both my 'competative' and 'judging' journeys in the 2024 season. I can now be found regularly at events within the East Midlands and beyond, so come say hello!</p>
  
  <p> You <em>may</em> also know me from <strike>Twitter</strike> X where I post under <a href="https://x.com/PTCGenius">@PTCGenius</a>.</p>
  
  <p> Outside of PTCG, I am a mobile app developer, Google Developer Expert, conference speaker, blogger and more. You can find out more about all that @ <a href ="http://spght.dev" class="spght">spght.dev</a> üçù</p>

<h5 class="question">"Ok, so what's all this site about then?"</h5>

This site is a passion project inspired by community members and players I have met. Known as 'Legacy Ed' locally, I <span class="love">&hearts;</span> building fun retro decks from previous formats but have always struggled to accurately document the decks I have built and easily share these with my friends or other players that are interested. 

Therefore, I built this site primarily as a reference for myself, but have now made it public in the hope it might inspire others to start building retro/legacy decks and share the love PTCG brings to so many!

<h5 class="question">"Err, what's with the name "PTCGenius"? I can't find your Limitless page..."</h5>

A good question and a valid point, the name is quite purposefully ironic but _please_ don't let my non-existant achievements get in the way of a good domain name üòå. In the long term, I have wider plans to utilise the domain for something more worthy of the title. Until then, it's just a bit of fun and, who knows, maybe I will see you at a Day 2 near you very soon!

<h5 class="question">"If you like retro decks so much, why haven't you built X deck? You really should!"</h5>

I am _always_ looking to try and play fun decks from any era. If you have a suggestion, then please [submit a suggestion here](https://github.com/ed-george/ptcgenius.github.io/issues/new?assignees=ed-george&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=request-a-deck.md&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+Deck%3A+XXX). I'd love to try it!

<h5 class="question">"Can I add you on X Pok√©mon platform"</h5>

Of course! Please do drop me a message via social(s) if you do so though
