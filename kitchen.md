  <p>Wondering what decks I am currently building at the moment? Then step inside my "kitchen" where I am usually cooking something tasty I have found on my travels!</p>

  <p>These lists are often from formats with cards that are harder to source, formats I am currently looking into more or even just cool decks I have seen played previously.</p>

  <p>Whenever possible, I will provide credit to the list's creator within the links or description of each page, however please open <a href="{{ site.repository.issue-template-url.deck | append: 'Attribution issue' | uri_escape }}" target="_blank">an issue</a> if you believe attribution is incorrect.</p>

  <p><em>Bon app√©tit</em> üë®‚Äçüç≥ - Ed</p>

    <h4>Can you help me cook?</h4>
  <p>These decks are likely part-complete, so if you are able to help source any of the physical cards <em>please</em> do let me know via social media (or IRL if you are at an upcoming UK event).</p>
  <p><a class="text-reset" href="https://x.com/PTCGenius">@PTCGenius</a> is a good place to find me ‚úåÔ∏è - Any offers of sales and/or trades can be considered!</p>
